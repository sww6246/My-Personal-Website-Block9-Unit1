            <h1>Sam Weber - Developer, <br>Builder, Creator</h1>
            <p>I am a FullStack Academy software engineering student with experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, REACT, and Python. I have spent the first 9 years of my career working in digital project management and marketing. I bring a unique perspective to development as a former administrator and UX strategist for multiple websites, with a focus on improving backend systems.</p>
            <p>It is my hope to continue to grow as a developer, building out both my backend and frontend skillsets to be the most effective fullStack developer.</p>
            <p>I am based out of Denver, CO and live here with my long time partner, and two cats Mango and Kiwi. In my freetime, I enjoy taking on new development projects, boxing, snowboarding, supporting Real Madrid, and playing tennis.</p>
